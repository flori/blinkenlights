=== Description

This Ruby library is named after an old joke, see
  http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/B/blinkenlights.html

It enables you to control the LEDs on your keyboard to signal digital numbers
between 0 and 7, events like received/transmitted network packets, or just
let them blink in visually pleasing patterns.

*Beware*: If you use BlinkenLights under Windows, not only the leds are
switched on/off but also the related keys are pressed/unpressed! This could
be quite confusing. ;)

=== Examples

The block form opens the TTY, that controls the LEDs, and closes/resets
the LEDs  it after the block has been processed:
 require 'blinkenlights'
 BlinkenLights.open do |bl|
   bl.off
   bl.circle
 end

It's also possible to manually close the object:
 require 'blinkenlights'
 bl = BlinkenLights.new
 bl.off
 100.times { bl.random }
 bl.close

There are also two short examples examples/netblinker.rb and
examples/loadbar.rb in the distribution directory of this library, that show
how to let the lights blink if network packets are received/transmitted on
your host or to indicate how high the cpu load average is.
