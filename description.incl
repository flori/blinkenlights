<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This pure Ruby library enables you to control the LEDs on your keyboard to
signal digital numbers between 0 and 7, events like received/transmitted
network packets, or just let them blink in visually pleasing patterns.

<p>
Make sure to have sufficient permissions to access the device (e.g.
/dev/console or /dev/tty8) that controls the keyboard. Running your script as
root should always help. :)
