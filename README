Requirements
============

This library requires Linux at the moment, and isn't usable on other Unixes
(yet). Depending on your keyboard LED positions some tweaking may be necessary,
see the RDOC documentation.

Installation
============

Just type into the command line as root:

# ruby install.rb

Or if you already use rubygems (you should!) just type and rubygems fetches
the gem and installs it for you:

# gem install blinkenlights

Documentation
=============

To create the documentation of this module, type

$ ruby make_doc.rb

and the API documentation is generated by your rdoc command in
the doc/ sub-directory.

Some small examples can be found in the examples directory of the distribution
directory. You very likely have to run it as root.
